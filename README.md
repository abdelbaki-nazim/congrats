**Congrats** is a fun and personalized congratulatory web app that allows users to create custom congratulation messages with ease. Just enter your name, generate a unique URL, and share it with friends to surprise them with a celebratory message and video!

## Features:
- ðŸ”¤ **Personalized Greeting:** Users can enter their name, and a unique URL is generated.
- ðŸ“§ **Shareable Link:** The link can be sent to friends, family, or colleagues for special occasions.
